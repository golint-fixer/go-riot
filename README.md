League of Legends API wrapper for Go

I'm writing this library as my first intro to Go, so please note that the structure and style of the code may not be the strongest from the start. It's a WIP and I'll improve the code once I get the wrapper completed functionally.

Note that there's one file dedicated for each controller/section defined on the [API documentation page](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods).
